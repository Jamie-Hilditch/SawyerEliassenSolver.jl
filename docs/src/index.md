# SawyerEliassenSolver.jl

A fast pseudospectral solver for the Sawyer-Eliassen equation written in Julia. 

## About 

- Solves the [forced Sawyer-Eliassen equation](@ref "The Sawyer-Eliassen equation").
- Utilises [pseudospectral discretisation](@ref "Pseudospectral discretisation") and [implicit time-stepping](@ref "Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta NystrÃ¶m").
- Run relatively large simulations (e.g. 1024x1024 grid) in a matter of minutes on a laptop.
